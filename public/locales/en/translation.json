    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
      "q1": "Why isn't the scanner starting?",
      "a1": "First, ensure you have selected a 'Scan Event'. The 'Start Scanning' button will be disabled until you do. If you selected a B2B delivery, you must also select a client. If it still doesn't work, you may need to grant camera permissions to your browser for this site.",
      "q2": "How is the 'Live Operations Dashboard' updated?",
      "a2": "Most metrics are calculated by formulas directly in the Google Sheet. However, inventory location counts (e.g., 'In Production Warehouse', 'Stock at Boutique') are updated dynamically by the backend script. When you perform a 'PRODUCTION_SCAN', the warehouse count increases. When you perform an outlet stock scan (e.g., 'BOUTIQUE_STOCK_SCAN'), the warehouse count decreases, and the boutique's stock count increases.",
      "q3": "Why does a product show as 'Unknown Product' in the log?",
      "a3": "This happens when the Product ID part of the scanned serial number does not match any 'Product ID' in your 'Master Product List' (in Settings). For example, if you scan 'CAKE-VAN-001', but you only have 'CAKE-CHOC' defined as a product, it will show as unknown.",
      "q4": "Can I edit a scan after it's been logged?",
      "a4": "No, the application is designed as an immutable log for data integrity. To correct an error, you would need to manually edit the 'Scanned Inventory Log' in the Google Sheet."
    },
    "bestPractices": {
      "title": "Best Practices",
      "p1": "<strong>Consistent Serial Numbers:</strong> Use a consistent format for your serial numbers, like `PRODUCT-ID-UNIQUE-NUMBER` (e.g., `CAKE-CHOC-101`). This is essential for the summary page to work correctly.",
      "p2": "<strong>Select the Correct Event:</strong> The accuracy of your dashboards depends entirely on selecting the correct scan event. Double-check your selection before scanning a batch of items.",
      "p3": "<strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Ensure QR codes are well-lit for fast and reliable scanning.",
      "p4": "<strong>Refresh Data:</strong> The dashboards show a snapshot of the data. Use the 'Refresh' button on each page to fetch the latest information from the Google Sheet."
